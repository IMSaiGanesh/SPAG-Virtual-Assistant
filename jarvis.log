2025-05-14 17:34:42,537 - INFO - Groq AI response: A fascinating figure, my friend! Lord Rama is a legendary character in Hindu mythology, considered to be the seventh avatar (incarnation) of the god Vishnu. He is the central figure in the epic Ramayana, which is one of the most revered and influential works of Hindu literature.

According to the Ramayana, Lord Rama was the prince of Ayodhya, the kingdom of his father, King Dasaratha. He was exiled to the forest for 14 years, along with his wife, Sita, and brother, Lakshmana, due to a curse by the wise sage, Vasishtha.

During his exile, Rama faced numerous challenges, including the abduction of Sita by the demon king, Ravana, who ruled the kingdom of Lanka. Rama, with the help of his brother and other allies, launched a war against Ravana and ultimately defeated him, rescuing Sita and reclaiming his rightful place as the king of Ayodhya.

Lord Rama is often revered as a symbol of duty, loyalty, and righteousness, and his story has had a profound impact on Indian culture and society. His heroism and devotion to his family and kingdom have inspired countless adaptations, interpretations, and artistic representations over the centuries.

Now, if you'll excuse me, I need to attend to some pressing matters. Tony Stark's latest project requires my immediate attention!
